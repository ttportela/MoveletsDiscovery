# Usage

You need to use the Jupyer Notebook avaible at ./method. Then, you can specify the dataset and the column to be analysed. 
The dataset must be splitted into train and test. 

The program reads the dataset in the format `dataset_train.csv` and `dataset_test.csv`. 

Pay attention to the `tid` and `label` columns in your dataset, already specified in the code. 
Also, you need to have a folder `outputs`.

In order to run the experiments, you need `pandas` and `numpy` libraries.
